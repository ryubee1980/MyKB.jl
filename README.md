## Computational scheme
In simulations, RDF data is obtained from a system of finite size, while the KB integral is theoretically defined for a system of infinite size. 
Hence one need to somehow "estimate" the value of the infinite system from that of a finite system.
An efficient extrapolation scheme has been proposed by

P. Kr√ºger, D. Bedeaux, S. Kjelstrup, T. Vlugt, J.-M. Simon, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. vol.4, (2013) 235.

The authors showed the double integral of pair correlation $h(r_{12})=g(r_{12})-1$ within a volume $V$ of a spherical shape is given by

$$
G(R)=\frac{1}{V}\int_V\int_V h(r_{12})dr_1dr_2=\int_0^{2R} h(r) w(r) dr,
$$

where $R$ is the radius of the sphere. The weight function $w(r)$ is given by

$$
w(r)=4\pi r^2(1-3x/2+x^3/2)
$$

with $x=r/2R$. Further, the authors showed that $G(R)$ behaves for large $R$ as

$$
G(R)\to G(\infty)+A/R \quad R\to\infty
$$

where $A$ is some constant and $G(\infty)$ is the KB integral that we wish to compute. 

Hence, we can estimate the KB integral $G(\infty)$ by the following:

1. Compute $G(R)$ from the RDF data for sufficiently large $R$'s. In simulations, RDF data is obtained for $r<r_{\rm max}$ with $r_{\rm max}$ being comparable with the box size of the simulation. Then one should note $R$ must be smaller than $r_{\rm max}/2$.
2. Find the $R$-range where $G(R)$ is linear in $1/R$. In this range, fit the curve (line) $1/R$ vs $G(R)$ by a linear function $B+A/R$. Then we extrapolate the curve to $R\to \infty$, i.e., $G(\infty)=B$.

## Radial distribution function (RDF) data
The RDF data should given by the distance values $r$ [nm] and the corresponding RDF $g(r)$ separated by a space. Lines that begin with #, @, or " are ignored.
